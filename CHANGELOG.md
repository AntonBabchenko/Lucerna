# Changelog

All notable changes to Lucerna are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims to
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Development happens continuously on `main`. Versions between `0.1.0` and the first
published release were untagged feature milestones; the first packaged public
release is **0.9.0**.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Self-update.** On startup the launcher checks GitHub Releases and, when a newer
  version is available, shows a sticky notification with a one-click **Update** button.
  Clicking it downloads the official installer, verifies it (SHA-256 against
  `SHA256SUMS` **and** cosign keyless against the release's `.cosign.bundle`, pinned to
  the release workflow's signing identity), launches it, and exits. An unverified binary
  is never launched. The install is always an explicit click — there is no silent
  background update. A Settings → General toggle ("Check for updates on startup",
  on by default) controls the check, and dismissing the notification suppresses it for
  that version until a newer release appears.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-05-31

### Changed
- **Renamed the project `FTlauncher` → `Lucerna`.** Binary/crate, identifiers
  (`com.lucerna.app`), keyring slots, per-instance directories, user-facing
  strings, and docs were updated. A one-shot, idempotent startup migration moves
  existing launcher data and per-instance directories to the new names.

### Added (feature milestones since 0.1.0)
- **Mod loaders:** Fabric (and Quilt as a Fabric superset), Forge (every era,
  1.7.10 through current), and NeoForge — installer logic runs in-process.
- **Mod browser:** search Modrinth + CurseForge in-app, filter by MC version and
  loader, automatic required-dependency resolution, and a standalone mod-update
  check.
- **Modpacks:** Modrinth and CurseForge modpack browser plus drag-and-drop import
  of `.mrpack` and CurseForge `.zip`, with version provenance carried forward and
  missing / distribution-disabled mods surfaced to the user.
- **Worlds:** per-instance world list with size and last-played, zip-backed
  backups (Replace / As-copy restore), and a guarded delete flow.
- **Logs:** three-source viewer (game / crash reports / launcher) with severity
  colouring, search-and-navigate, line-wrap and stack-trace folding, structured
  crash-report view, and one-click share to mclo.gs with client-side anonymisation.
- **Playtime:** per-instance session-time tracking on the Overview tab.
- **System integration:** opt-in hide-to-tray on launch with auto-restore,
  light/dark/system theme picker, and first-visit guided tours.
- **Microsoft / Xbox Live sign-in** wired up end-to-end (final step gated on
  pending Microsoft Azure app approval; offline accounts remain fully usable).
- **Transparency:** single network chokepoint with a static host allowlist and a
  single subprocess module, both enforced by structural tests.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-13

### Added
- First release. Vanilla Minecraft launch, offline accounts, and per-instance
  isolated `.minecraft` directories, with the launcher downloading the correct
  Java runtime per Minecraft version.
